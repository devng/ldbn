\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Stephen J. Hegner, who has supported me 
throughout my thesis with his patience and knowledge 
while allowing me the room to work in my own way. 
Without him this report would not have been completed. In addition, I would like to thank Per Lindström
for giving me the opportunity to write this thesis.

Last but not least, I thank my family for their love and support.
