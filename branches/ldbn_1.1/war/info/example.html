	It is easy to modify the information shown here. It is a simple static html 
	file, which is stored in the <i>info</i> folder, and it can easily be 
	edited.

	Internationalisation will also be very easy, since people, who would like to 
	translate the information, have an easy access to the the file. They can 
	just save it under another name, following a specific conversion, and 
	translate it.
