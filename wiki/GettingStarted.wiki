= Getting Started with LDBN =

In this guide we will use Eclipse IDE (ver. 3.6 Helios for Java EE Developers) on Windows XP, but the installation should be similar for other Eclipse versions and OS (a Linux installation guide will follow soon).  

It is assumed that we use GWT ver. 2.3.0.

== Installing the Necessary Software ==

 * Download and install Eclipse IDE and create a new workspace. More information on Eclipse and installation notes can be found [http://www.eclipse.org/ here].

 * Install the Subclipse Eclipse Plugin for accessing the SVN server. More information on Subclipse and installation notes can be found [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ here].

 * Install the Google Plugin for Eclipse as described [http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/install-eclipse-3.6.html here]. This should install the GWT 2.3.0 SDK as well. Install all other components of the plugin, although we do not need an App Engine support for the time being. 
  * If a you need another version of the GWT SDK then you need to manually download it form [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/versions.html here]. 
  * Then you need to configure the plugin to use that version. This is done in _Window->Preferences->Google->Web Toolkit_. Just add the GWT SDK in the list and make it the default GWT SDK.

== Checking out the LDBN Project from the Repository ==

 * In Eclipse go to _File->New->Other..._. From the Dialog choose _SVN->Checkout Projects from SVN_

 * Select _Create new repository location_ and click _Next_

 * Enter the following URL _http://ldbn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/_ and click _Next_

 * Select the top-level _ldbn_ folder, click _Next_. Use the default project name _ldbn_ and click *_Finish_*

Please note that you only have read rights for the project. If you would like to commit code please contact me.

== Starting LDBN Locally ==

Before starting LDBN locally you have to install an Apache web server with PHP and a MySQL Database. However, installing and configuring  a Web-server and a database could be quite complicated. Therefore, for testing purposes We recommend to use [http://www.apachefriends.org/de/xampp.html XAMPP]. XAMPP will install all for the LDBN Project necessary components. 

Please note that you should use XAMPP only for testing purposes!

=== Configuration of the Apache Server ===

After you have installed XAMPP your Apache server is configured and ready to use. However, since we are not going to use the GWT's built-in Jetty Web-server we need to do some additional configuration of our Apache Web-server.

 * Open the _http.conf_ file of your Apache server with a text editor. Usually the file is located in _<xampp installation folder>/apache/conf_ 

 * Add the following at the end of the file:
{{{
# Alias for LDBN
Alias /ldbn "<Eclipse Workspace Folder>/ldbn/war"
<Directory "<Eclipse Workspace Folder>/ldbn/war">
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI
       AllowOverride All
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
</Directory>
}}}

 * Note that you have to change _<Eclipse Workspace Folder>_ with the actual path to your Eclipse Workspace, e.g. _C:/workspace_

 * Restart the server

=== Configuration of the MySQL Database ===

The default configuration for the database is sored in the _config.php_ file, which is located in the _war/php_ folder of the LDBN project. Thus if you should use other database configurations then you should edit this file. For the default DB configuration you should do the following:

 * You can use phpMyAdmin http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ for the MySQL database manipulation. The tool is installed by default from XAMPP. 

 * Create new database called _ldbn_

 * Crate the necessary database tables and sample data by using the _ldbn.sql_ and _example.sql_ files, both of which are located in the _recourses/DB_ folder.  

 * Create new database user for the _ldbn_ data base called _ldbn_ with a password _1234_. The new database user should have the following rights: _SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE_
  * You can use a different database user and password, but then you have to change the PHP configuration of LDBN, which is located in _war/php/config.php_

=== Change the Run Configuration for the Eclipse Project ===

We need to create a new Eclipse _Run Configuration_ for the project. Do the following:

 * First we need to compile the project into JavaScript. This is necessary only the first time you are running LDBN. 
  * Right click on the Project folder _Google->GWT Compile_.

 * In Eclipse do a right mouse click on the file _Ldbn.html_ located in the _war_ folder. Then go to _Run As -> Web Application (running on an external server)_. 

    http://ldbnonline.com/wiki/run-step1.jpg

 * This opens a new pop-up dialog. 
  * For _External server root_ enter _http://localhost/ldbn_.
  * Check the check box _Select an HTML page:_
  * In the list _Matching items:_ select _Ldbn.html_
  * Click the _OK_ button

    http://ldbnonline.com/wiki/run-step2.jpg

 * This should make a new run configuration for Ldbn and run it. To open the application by double clicking on the link in the _Development Mode_ view. Or you can start the application in any browser using the following URL: _http://localhost/ldbn/Ldbn.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997_

 * You can compile the application at any time and run it by using the following URL: _http://localhost/ldbn/Ldbn.html_. Note that the compiled application runs much faster.
