#Information about howto checkout the LDBN project and how to compile it 

= Introduction =

In this guide we will use Eclipse IDE (version 3.5 Galileo) for Java EE Developers on Windows XP, but the installation should be similar for other Eclipse versions and OS (a Linux installation guide will follow soon).  

It is assumed that we use GWT ver. 1.7.1.

= Installing the Necessary Software =

 * Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers and create a new workspace. More information on Eclipse and installation notes can be found [http://www.eclipse.org/ here].

 * Install the Subclipse Eclipse Pluging for accessing the SVN server. More information on Subclipse and installation notes can be found [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ here].

 * Install the Google Plugin for Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) as described [http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/install-eclipse-3.5.html here]. This will install GWT ver. 1.7.1 . Install all other componets of the plugin, although we do not need an App Engine support for the time being.
