As the core of a previous thesis~\cite{mt1}, a web-based tool, called LDBN(Learn DataBase
Normalization), was developed. The purpose of this tool is to provide an interactive learning
environment for the normalization of relational database schemata whose constraints are
defined by functional dependencies (FDs). During the Fall term of 2008, LDBN was used in
conjunction with the course Principles of Database Systems at the Department of Computing
Science at Umeå University, and some important observations were made. 

As a part of this thesis, some
crucial extensions to LDBN, based upon these observations, are developed.
The most significant extension is a tool for the visualization of FDs, based
upon templates found in popular textbooks such as~\cite{bdb1} and~\cite{bdb2}. Often, such visual
representations are much easier for humans to grasp than purely text-based representations.
However, this extension does not compromise the existing capabilities of LDBN. 
In addition, we present some other shortcoming of the previous version of LDBN and our approach to
deal with those. We also discuss
problems that lie within educational and web-based software development.
