	Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database 
	tables to minimize duplication of information in order to safeguard the 
	database against certain types of logical or structural problems, 
	namely data anomalies. Therefore database normalization is a central topic 
	in database theory, and its right understanding is crucial for students, 
	but it is very often consider as pure theoretical topic and it is being 
	disregarded by the students. To help avoid the above problems LDBN was 
	developed by <a href="mailto:ens07ngv@cs.umu.se">Nikolay Georgiev</a> as a 
	part of his master thesis at the university
	of Ume&aring;, Sweden, under the supervision of 
	<a href="http://www.cs.umu.se/~hegner/" target="_blank">Stephen J. Hegner</a>.

	LDBN is a A web-based environment for learning relational-database
	normalization. LDBN is aiming to improve the undersending and knowledge of 
	relational-database normalization of students, who are currently learning 
	database theory and are already familiar with the basic of relational-database
	normalization.

	The students can test their knowledge but solving an assignment, 
	which consists of attributes and functional dependencies 
	(FDs). These represents a relationship. The user (the student) then have to 
	find different decompositions of the relation. <BR>
	The user can check his solution with LDBN, then LDBN performs series of checks 
	and the result is shown in a information window. The user are given small 
	hints were the mistake might be. If the user is still uncertain about the
	right solution, then LDBN can provide him with a sample solution as well. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Other features of LDBN include an easy way for lecturers to create 
	new assignments and users to leave comments for each assignment.
