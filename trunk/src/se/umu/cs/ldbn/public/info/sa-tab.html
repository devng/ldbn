<h2>Solve assignment tab<br>
</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This tab opens a widget, where students
can give a solution to a given assignment. An assignment consists of
attributes and FDs, which are representing a relationship. The user
(the student) then have to find different decompositions of the
relation. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: bold;">New assignment button<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Loads a new assignment from a data
base. A dialog window will prompt the user to choose an assignment
from a list of predefined assignments.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: bold;">Check Solution button<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Checks the solution of the user. A
series of checks are being computed and the result is shown in a
information window. The user are given small hints were the mistake
might be. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: bold;">Show Solution button<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Shows a solution of the assignments.
Please note there can be various solutions, but the program is
showing only one of them. Furthermore the “checking solution”
algorithms work separately from the “show solution” algorithms,
thus checking the solution is not based on the solution shown by the
program.<br>
