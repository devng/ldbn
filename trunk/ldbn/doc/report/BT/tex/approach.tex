\chapter{Approach}
\label{chap:approach}

In this chapter we discuss some design decisions of our solution such as 
platform choice, as well as a formal overview of out implementation. 

In the following the term client is used to refer to a
browser.

There are many different techniques to implement a web-based application. 
The problem specifies that the solution must be able  on the one hand to communicate with LDBN 
and on the other hand to extend some of its capabilities, 
thus a basic HTML solution will not be able to achieve our goal, 
since all pages in that case are static. 

The remaining options can be divided into 3 groups, client-side, server-side and
a client-server based. The client-side solutions consist of a Java applet or a Flash
application which are downloaded to the browser and then run on the user's computer
using a plugin. Server-side includes solutions built in PHP, ASP, ASP.NET, C/C++ or
Perl, all which is ran on the server and then sent to the user's browser. The third one is
a client-server based idea called Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). It works
almost the same as the server-side solutions but acts more interactively.
