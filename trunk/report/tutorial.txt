Tutorial 

This guide will show you how to check out the LDBN project with Eclipse IDE. 
And run it locally on your system. The tutorial it focused on installing LDBN on 
Windows XP operating system, but you can install it practically with a similar
approach on every system, on which you can run GWT, MySQL and Apache Web Server 
with PHP5. This tutorial will not include a guide on how to install MySQL or 
Apache Web Server, but if you have troubles with that part, I suggest you to 
install XAMPP, which is a free and open source cross-platform web server 
package, which will install and configure automatically among others also the 
Apache Web Server and MySQL, and also useful tools like PHPMyAdmin, which is 
an administration tool for MySQL over the Internet. XAMPP is available for 
download at http://www.apachefriends.org . 
A Getting Started guide with GWT (Google Web Toolkit) is available at:
http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/gettingstarted.html . You need the GWT, in 
order to compile LDBN from Java source code into JavaScript, and thus run it 
on a web server.


1. Checking out LDBN from SVN repository
I assume You have already installed GWT, and continue. You need to create a new
project with GWT. You can do that after checking out the project from the 
repository, but doing it before that is easier. 
Follow the steps in the "Getting Started guide with GWT (Google Web Toolkit)"
under the "Creating an Application from Scratch (with Eclipse)". Name your 
project ldbn , with lower case letters only.
