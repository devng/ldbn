Abstract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database tables 
to minimize duplication of information in order to safeguard the database 
against certain types of logical or structural problems, namely data anomalies. 
Therefore database normalization is a central topic in database theory, and its 
correct understanding is crucial for students. The subject it is often 
considered to be dry and purely theoretical and it is widely being disregarded 
by the students. A web-based tool is developed to give students an interactive 
hands-on experience in database normalization process, and to provide lecturers 
with an easy way for creating and testing student assignments on the subject.  
The tool is suitable for relational database and design and data management 
courses. This paper describes the web-based tool and the approach to creating a 
web based application and the problems that lies within this kind of software 
development. The paper also provides a tutorial on the right usage of the tool.
