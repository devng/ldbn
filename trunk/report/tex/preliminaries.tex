\subsection{Decomposition algorithms}

- Minimal cover algorithm.

- Decomposition into 3NF and BCNF.

- Finding key candidate.

\subsection{Algorithms for testing}

- Why are the above algorithms not enough?

- Attribute closure.

- Member.

- Equivalence.

- TEST Minimal cover.

- Reduction by resolution.

- Finding all key candidates.

- Testing for lossless/nonaditive join property.

- Testing for dependency preservation. 

- Testing for 2NF, 3NF, BCNF properly.

- And putting all the algorithms together -> interaction with each other.
