\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Stephen J. Hegner, who has supported me 
throughout my thesis with his patience and knowledge 
while allowing me the room to work in my own way. 
Without him this report would not have been completed.

I would also like to thank Michael H\"ofling for all his help during my stay in Sweden.
Last, and most importantly, I thank my family for their love and support.
