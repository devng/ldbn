Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database tables to minimize
duplication of information in order to safeguard the database against certain types of logical or
structural problems, namely data anomalies. Therefore database normalization is a central topic in
database theory, and its correct understanding is crucial for students. The subject it is sometimes considered to be
dry and purely theoretical and it is being disregarded by the students. A web-based tool is developed to give students an interactive hands-on experience in database normalization process, and to privide lecturers with an easy way for creating and testing student assignments on the subject.  The tool is suitable for relational database and design and data management courses. This paper describes the web-based tool and the approach to creating a web based application and the problems that
lies within this kind of software development. The paper also provides a tutorial on the right usege of the tool.
